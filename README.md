## END TO End ML Project 


Certainly! Here's an example flow in bullet points:

Receive request through IMS protocol
Split files into sections, if necessary
Extract text from each section
Classify text using pre-trained algorithms
Merge files based on classification categories
Upload merged files to Athenaeum
Once the request is received, the files are split to separate different sections, if necessary. Then, the text is extracted from each section and sent to the classification engine, where it is classified using pre-trained algorithms. Once the text is classified, the files are merged based on their classification categories, and the resulting files are uploaded to Athenaeum for storage and future retrieval.


Sure, I can describe a use case where a client logs in to a sandbox system to perform model training and lifecycle management of models on a portal. Here's an overview:

The client logs in to the sandbox system using their credentials.
They navigate to the model training section of the portal and select the dataset they want to use for training.
They choose the algorithm(s) they want to use for training and configure the hyperparameters.
Once the model training is complete, the client can evaluate the model's accuracy and make any necessary adjustments to the hyperparameters or algorithm.
If the model accuracy meets the client's requirements, they can choose to publish the model to UAT (User Acceptance Testing) or PPD (Pre-Production Deployment).
If the client chooses to publish the model to UAT or PPD, the portal will automatically generate a snow ticket to request deployment to production.
The client can track the progress of the deployment request via the portal and receive notifications when the model is deployed to production.
Throughout the process, the client has access to various features and tools to manage the lifecycle of the models, including versioning, retraining, and monitoring. The portal also provides insights and analytics to help the client make informed decisions about their models.
