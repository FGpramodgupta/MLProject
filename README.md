## END TO End ML Project 


Certainly! Here's an example flow in bullet points:

Receive request through IMS protocol
Split files into sections, if necessary
Extract text from each section
Classify text using pre-trained algorithms
Merge files based on classification categories
Upload merged files to Athenaeum
Once the request is received, the files are split to separate different sections, if necessary. Then, the text is extracted from each section and sent to the classification engine, where it is classified using pre-trained algorithms. Once the text is classified, the files are merged based on their classification categories, and the resulting files are uploaded to Athenaeum for storage and future retrieval.
